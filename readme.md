**this is my choclate milkshake recipe**

*To get the best taste in chocolate shake*

.I would suggest using a good quality cocoa powder.
.Both ice cream and ice cubes are optional and you can skip them. You can add either vanilla ice cream or chocolate ice cream or choco chip .ice cream in the milkshake.
.Without ice cream also the chocolate milkshake tastes good.
.For a dairy free version of chocolate shake, you can use almond milk or soy milk.
